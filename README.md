# Vulkan_Specs

The goal was to write my first renderer by following the video series niagra by zeux(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ezuDjNxEbCiba829s7gSQ), 
this does have the triangle and resizing and if you write some shaders you can do some primitive stuff, but the code is a mess so I abandoned it to write it over
and hopefully have a clean and consistent base, because it looks as though two people who can not work together, wrote it by accident.
